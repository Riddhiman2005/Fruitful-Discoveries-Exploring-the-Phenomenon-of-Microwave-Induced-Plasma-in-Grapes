This article presents an investigation into the phenomenon of
**microwave-induced plasma** in grape hemispheres. The experiment involved exposing pairs of grape hemispheres to intense
microwave radiation, which resulted in the ignition of a plasma.
We moved forward and made different cases to study properties
of induced plasma in each cases.
