**Plasma** is often referred to as the fourth state of matter, after solids, liquids, and gases.
It is a state of matter that is distinct from these other states and exhibits unique
properties that are not found in them. One of the defining features of plasma is that it
consists of charged particles, such as ions and electrons. These charged particles interact
with each other through electromagnetic forces, creating a highly dynamic system that
can be difficult to understand and control.

## History, Discovery, Origin and Its Sources ##


The discovery of plasma as a distinct state of matter is
attributed to the work of Irving Langmuir, an American chemist and physicist.

In the early 20th century, Langmuir was studying the properties of gases at low
pressures and discovered that by applying an electric
current to a gas, he could create a new state of matter
that was distinct from solids, liquids, and gases. This
state was characterized by the presence of charged particles, such as ions and electrons, and was given the
name ”plasma” by Langmuir, who was inspired by the
resemblance of the glowing gas to blood plasma.

### Occurence ###

In nature, plasma is found in phenomena such as lightning,aurora-s and the Stars like Sun. 
Plasma is also found in  plasma TVs, fluorescent lighting, and plasma cutting for metal fabrication. Also, due to extensive researches In addition, plasma is being studied for its potential applications in medicine, such as plasma-based sterilization techniques and plasma-assisted wound healing.
