# Plasma #


**Plasma** is often referred to as the fourth state of matter, after solids, liquids, and gases.
It is a state of matter that is distinct from these other states and exhibits unique
properties that are not found in them. One of the defining features of plasma is that it
consists of charged particles, such as ions and electrons. These charged particles interact
with each other through electromagnetic forces, creating a highly dynamic system that
can be difficult to understand and control
