**Plasma** is often referred to as the fourth state of matter, after solids, liquids, and gases.
It is a state of matter that is distinct from these other states and exhibits unique
properties that are not found in them. One of the defining features of plasma is that it
consists of charged particles, such as ions and electrons. These charged particles interact
with each other through *electromagnetic forces*, creating a highly dynamic system that
can be difficult to understand and control.

## History, Discovery, Origin and Its Sources ##


The discovery of plasma as a distinct state of matter is
attributed to the work of **Irving Langmuir**, an American chemist and physicist.

In the early 20th century, Langmuir was studying the properties of gases at low
pressures and discovered that by applying an electric
current to a gas, he could create a new state of matter
that was distinct from solids, liquids, and gases. This
state was characterized by the presence of charged particles, such as ions and electrons, and was given the
name ”plasma” by Langmuir, who was inspired by the
resemblance of the glowing gas to blood plasma.

In nature, plasma is found in phenomena such as **lightning,aurora-s and the Stars like Sun**.

Plasma is also found in  *plasma TVs, fluorescent lighting, and plasma cutting for metal fabrication*. Also, due to extensive researches in this field, we got to know about many potential application os plasma in  In medicines like **plasma-based sterilization techniques and plasma-based wound healing**.

Plasma state is a highly dynamic system that can exhibit unique properties, such as the ability to conduct electricity, emit light, and generate magnetic fields.

## Types of Plasma ##

![Plasma Table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130882317/236657806-a07ff40c-1d4c-4e91-9b76-bd23d6c86080.jpg)

Plasma can be classified into two main types based on the thermal conditions of the
plasma with the surrounding environment: equilibrium and non-equilibrium plasma.
Understanding the differences between equilibrium and non-equilibrium plasma is important for designing and optimizing plasma-based technologies.

###  Equilibrium Plasma ##

Equilibrium plasma refers to a state where the plasma is in thermal equilibrium with
its surroundings. This means that the temperature of the plasma is uniform and the
same as the temperature of the surrounding gas or material. In equilibrium plasma,
the number of charged particles, such as electrons and ions, is balanced, and there is
no net charge in the plasma.

### Non Equilibrium Plasma ###

Non-equilibrium plasma, on the other hand, refers to a state where the plasma is not in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. This means that the temperature of the
plasma is not uniform and can be much hotter or colder than the surrounding gas or
material. Non-equilibrium plasma is characterized by the presence of energetic electrons
and ions, which can have a significant impact on the behavior of the plasma. Nonequilibrium plasma can be created by various methods, such as applying an electric field
or using high-energy radiation. Non-equilibrium plasma has many unique properties that make it useful for a wide range of applications, such as in plasma cutting and
welding, surface treatment, and plasma-based medicine.
