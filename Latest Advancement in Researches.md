## Mie- Resonance Hypothesis ##

In practice, as long as the grapes—or any other similarly sized pair of ion-rich aqueous spheres—are in contact, cutting is unnecessary. Isolated spheres, however, never spark. Traditional explanations for the plasma formation almost invariably invoke a mechanism, such as surface plasmon (ions of plasma states) resonances, that relies on high surface conductivity, but new research is exploring bulk optical mechanisms such as Mie resonances. At 2.45 GHz (Hertz is the unit of frequency) , the typical frequency of consumer microwave ovens, water has a refractive index above 8 and relatively small absorption. That makes each grape, with a diameter of about 1.5 cm, the right size, composition, and shape for resonant scattering and produces a concentrated electric field at their point of contact. A Canadian collaboration between **Aaron Slepkov** at Trent University and Pablo Bianucci at Concordia University is investigating the Mie-resonance hypothesis by comparing experimental observations with simulations of lossy whispering-gallery modes in aqueous dielectric spheres and dimers at microwave frequencies.

## Elastic- Leidenfrost Effect ##

When aqueous dimers, similar in size to grapes, are exposed to microwave radiation in a microwave oven, a powerful electromagnetic hotspot forms at the point where they touch, often leading to the creation of plasma. Surprisingly, this irradiation not only generates electromagnetic effects but also results in the injection of mechanical energy. Through careful examination using high-speed imaging, we have observed that irradiated hydrogel dimers repeatedly collide and bounce off each other.

By analyzing the imaging data, we have determined that an average of 1 μJ (micronewton-second) of mechanical energy is injected into the dimers during each collision. Additionally, we have noticed a distinctive high-pitched audio signal accompanying each collision. This audio signal and energy injection arise from the complex interaction between vaporization and elastic deformations occurring at the contact region of the dimers, a phenomenon we refer to as the **'elastic Leidenfrost effect'.**
