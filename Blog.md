A little bit about "Everlasting Quest For Physics". It's an initiative to groom the interest in science for general students. Most of the students from my locality, or in broad spectrum shifts towards
science not as a matter of interest, but mostly because of good grades,social steretoypes and vast number of opportunities-medical/Enginnering. 

EQP blogs try to focus on growing the interests for Physics( specially) and Science as a whole.
