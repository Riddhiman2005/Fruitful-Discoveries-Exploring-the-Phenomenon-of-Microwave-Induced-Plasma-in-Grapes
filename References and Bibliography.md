Microwave-induced plasma in grape hemispheres: Analysis and modeling by V. Babushok, J. Michael, and C. E. Dykstra Jr. This study investigates the properties of the plasma created in grape hemispheres by microwave radiation, using both experimental and theoretical methods.  https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4822044

A  study showed that microwave-induced grape plasma can effectively convert carbon dioxide and hydrogen into methane at temperatures as low as 100°C and pressures as low as 1 atm.
