## Aim and Target ##
• Using **cheap, readily-available equipment**, creating a spectacular
light show in the kitchen <br>
• Promote **Interest, Love, and Excitement for Science** among
budding and prospective School Students

## Materials Required ##

• A pack of *Green Grapes*. We may also use **Hydrogel Water Beads** to get the same
results. <br>
• **Microwave Oven** <br>
• Plates that can withstand Microwave vibrations and won’t crack <br>
• **Knife**- For slicing the Grapes <br>
• Camera or Mobile Phone to record the sparklings <br>

## Procedure ##
• Slice the grape such that the thin isthmus is still holding the two halves together. Or one can also keep two grapes such that they are in touch.  <br>

• Next, place them sliced side up (do this process if you've sliced the grapes). <br>

• Place the plate with the prepared grapes into the center of the microwave oven
and shut the door carefully. The microwave is set to cook at full power for 35-40
seconds. <br>
• The sparks will start approximately 5 seconds after the microwave is started. <br>
• Approximately 2-3 seconds after that, the force of the sparks separated the grape
halves (the isthmus burns out) by approximately 1-1.5 cm, ending the effects. At
this point, stop the microwave to prevent further damage. <br>

## Results ##

We will see **flares** and **sparks** associated with the grapes *as an effect of microwaves*.
